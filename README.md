# UCLA DMA 172 Compressed Cinema Final
In Fall 2019, I took a class with Casey Reas on Compressed Cinema. For the final project, I wrote this drawing program that my classmates used to rotoscope a short video. You can view the final video [here on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCEJFAOLlxQ&t=15s). 

After the basic frame-swaping rotoscroping functionality, I added the colorpicker and added navigation tools as requested by my classmates Jimmy Zhi, Stephen Heo, and Seenahm Suriyasat. 

#### Mental health note
I'd like to note that at the time, I was suffering from a really intense depression, so it's surprising I was able to write any code at all, let alone a usable program for my friends. I remember feeling ashamed of writing so little code, but looking back, I am quite proud of myself.
